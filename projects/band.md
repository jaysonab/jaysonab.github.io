summary: Learned teamwork throughout my six years playing in my school's band by being the member that contributes nothing and changing to be a member that gives their all.

# Contributing Nothing #
I won't lie and say that I've always been a person that gives it my all towards everything I do, because that's not how I am as a person. I have faults and I've had times where I've wanted nothing to do with anything and band was just that. I was first forced to sign up for band as my parents wanted me to participate in something that involved dealing with others rather than just myself. As I signed up, I chose saxophone as my instrument and continued the year dedicating no time. By the end of my first year, I was almost last in standings in terms of saxophone ranking, and I continued to be like that until my third year. At the school I attended, there were three tiers of bands: freshman, wind II, and wind I. I was in the freshman band and decided to stay after our required time to hear what wind I sounded like. It blew my mind how different and on point the whole band sounded. The band was acting as a single unit, flowing in and out of parts unlike anything I heard or experienced live myself. 

# Retribution and Lessons #

If there's anything that thrives off of an athletic pedagogy type training, that'd be band and practicing an instrument. In my third year, I started practicing and eventually became the first chair for the tenor saxophone, the indivdiual that performs the best on that instrument. The ending of that year, I tested to place into wind I, and I got accepted. However, when I got in, it was different from how I imagined. The songs were a lot harder, and the people were a lot more dedicated. Everyone took lessons on the side to get their own parts down, dedicated hours of outside time, and spent the entire class session focused. It was a group that wanted to be there. I started practicing everyday myself and asked my instructor for help on timings or parts of music that got too difficult for me to handle myself. I spent my free time during school in the band room setting up and practicing. I did that for the following two years until I graduated and played my last part in the final song. 

There's nothing better than something finally clicking, and music clicks beautifully when every part is done at the right time. Just hearing an individual be off can be painstaking to hear often, and that was me. However, I eventually became part of the well-oiled machine that was wind I, the band that inspired me to try and achieve what they could achieve. I learned fundamental motivation skills and the meaning of teamwork since spending time on one part for hours can be detrimental in a group setting. There has to be as much effort from all parties to succeed.
