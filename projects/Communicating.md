# The Premise #
Kumon is a tutoring service that kids of all ages can join to get tutored in math and reading. When the child registers, they are tested and put into their own personal plan by the head of the center. From there, they use worksheets and tests to move up from level to level to eventually complete the program. Children can end up doing problems that they won't encounter for another six years or so if they advance far enough.

# The Challenge #
The main problem that I encounter everyday when working at kumon is the trouble of having kids asking for help on concepts where one child may learn it more efficently in a way no other child does it. When first starting, I struggled really hard to get children to be able to understand concepts if I were teaching it to them for the first time. I would apologize and send them to a different instructor if I couldn't get through to them the way I viewed it.
