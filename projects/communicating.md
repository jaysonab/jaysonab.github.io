# The Premise #
Kumon is a tutoring service that kids of all ages can join to get tutored in math and reading. When the child registers, they are tested and put into their own personal plan by the head of the center. From there, they use worksheets and tests to move up from level to level to eventually complete the program. Children can end up doing problems that they won't encounter for another six years or so if they advance far enough.

# The Challenge #

The main problem that I encounter everyday when working at kumon is the trouble of having kids asking for help on concepts where one child may learn it more efficently in a way no other child does it. When first starting, I struggled really hard to get children to be able to understand concepts if I were teaching it to them for the first time. I would apologize and send them to a different instructor if I couldn't get through to them the way I viewed it. Then, another issue is reteaching a child a concept if they forget something. A situation like that causes for an explanation that has to make sense to the child for that concept, then relating it back to what they initially asked. Problems like this occur on the daily.

# The Reward #
Although I really struggled at first, I eventually picked up skills along the way when more and more kids asked for help. Even though kids learn things differently, I could incorporate things I previously did, but also approach the problem differently. For example, if a young child is having trouble grasping fractions, you could grasp it in a visual sense with something like pie or pizza rather than in a purely mathematical standpoint. I've developed the ability to think about how I could compare concepts or ideas that I learn or my peers do, and find a way to communicate that in multiple ways if someone isn't getting it. It's helped me develop my teamwork skills ever since I started the job and I continuously improve with every working day and chance I get.
