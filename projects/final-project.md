I took Communications 210H in the Fall of 2018 at Leeward Community College. It's a course that focuses on cultural perspectives and expanding our knowledge on the many cultures that exist today. Many of the major projects throughout the semester was individual, however, the last final project was group based and randomly chosen. The final project consisted of live interviews, primary and secondary sources, a presentation with a time requirement of at least 20 minutes, and a paper to go along with it. 

# Leading Up to Presentation Day #
When the project was first assigned everyone in my group chose their respective part of French culture, a culture we chose, and silently worked amongst ourselves for a week to just gather research. Everything was going well until one day someone decided to not show up to class on a designated project work day. Without that person, the individual who was responsible for handling our live interviews, we had a big gap in our presentation, but we figured it would be okay since we still had a little over a month left until it was presentation day. However, the next class period was also a designated project work day, and that same member still didn't show up. At that point, I took it upon myself to just ask the members if they had any ideas since the missing member seemed to just disappear. Eventually, we agreed upon meeting the french professor, trying to reach natives to get first hand interviews on etiquette, and asking fellow peers if they've experienced visits to France or know anyone who has.

I scheduled meeting times through emails and asked members to attend for me if I couldn't fit the times of the person we were interviewing. Eventually, in the next class period the missing group member came to class, but they showed up empty handed. Not a single interview was done. In that entire week of being missing, it's as if they just got added into the group. Then, the presentation slides were very inconsistent with some slides being much lower quality than others, so I had to go through every slide and change wording or add visuals to help guide viewers to not cause confusion. Similarly to the presentation slides being inconsistent, the paper was more so a mess with everyone having different writing styles and syntax. Our professor proofread our paper and suggested so many changes it was easier to rewrite the whole thing. I started fixing the paper right away as there was only a week left now. I barely managed to get it completed, but it was done. Then there was presentation day.

# Presentation Day #
The day came for presentations, and just as I had expected, some members practiced, and some did not. There inconsistent presentation times, such as me going on for about ten minutes of total time to try and fill up space for the members that were winging it, and then there were members that only spoke for about a minute to two minutes. I tried my hardest to fill in remaining time with any miscellaneous information I could think of about French culture that I've learned in the past month of research, but the time was still only 18:36. We didn't meet time. However, I know I tried my best and that was that. I took responsibility when it was needed and tried to pick up the slack and motivate my members to do small things that could just make any progress on our project. I constantly asked for updates or availabilities to try plan things. It was a first time for me since I'm usually passive, but I didn't want my grade to suffer. I had to adapt and put myself out there.
