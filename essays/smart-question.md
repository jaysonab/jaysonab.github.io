# The Question Plague #
I always grew up being told, "There's no such thing as a stupid question." However, I've also heard, "Think before you talk." So which is the correct? Well, when it comes to asking a question there can be two approaches: the "smart" way or the "not so smart" way. Simply put, it's how you word it that can make a world a difference. Having a poorly worded question can make others think that the asker is asking for A, but in actuality they may be asking for Z. This in turn, makes the answer much harder and longer to get to. This is negativily effecting both the individual that asked the question and the one that answered. It's a road that leads to no where.

# The More Detail the Better Right? #
Well, yes, but also no. We need to realize what information is relevant to the question and what isn't. If I attach a whole monologue to a question that can be asked and answered in 10 second with the information that's needed, then why do so? However, lack of information is always an issue. If we look at this user's [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37913482/whats-that-mean-each-code) on StackOverFlow, we can see how poorly worded it is. The question post itself has 27 downvotes and a single answer that only solves a tiny portion of their question.

The user's title is "What's that mean each code" and their only questions are "What that mean," and "and static let ?" This leaves little information for any responder to reply with a proper answer. There is no information about what the exact issue is aside from, "UInt32 = 0x1 << 1 ?" and "and static let ?". There's nothing about what they specifically don't understand since the title lacks any information in the title and the body. Someone was kind enough to give an example of what the "<<" does within the code itself, but that was the post's only response. A question that's poorly done gives off the impression that the individual asking the question doesn't want to put effort into trying to learn something new. So why should anyone give even more effort to explain something to that individual?
