I've been told countless times that HTML and CSS are easy languages to understand with little to no complexity in it since it's all self explanatory. I can somewhat agree with that, although I admit that I struggled at first to get used to the syntax and structure of both. However, using a framework is an entirely different story. I appreciate how using a framework already makes the creation look "modern," but the complexity of it is leagues above basic html and css.

When I think of how difficult Semantic UI is, it can be described as both easy and hard, in a sense. I say that because Semantic uses syntax that can be comparable to how English is spoken. If you want to make a big image, you can just "ui large image" or something along those lines. The process is easy, however, the combinations are endless. The fact that Semantic allows customization on a big scale allows for creativity and freedom. The cost of it is just learning what combinations work and how they are applied. The single most difficult thing I encoutered when working with Semantic was the amount of <div> tags that are made.

When it comes to HTML <div> tags are used to divide up sections that you may want to create, and Semantic doesn't hold back on that aspect. I got lost when creating just simple menus since that itself required multiple <div> tags.
