I've been told countless times that HTML and CSS are easy languages to understand with little to no complexity in it since it's all self explanatory. I can somewhat agree with that, although I admit that I struggled at first to get used to the syntax and structure of both. However, using a framework is an entirely different story. I appreciate how using a framework already makes the creation look "modern," but the complexity of it is leagues above basic html and css.

# The Scary Journey # 
Semantic is like going on a long, hilly hike. The beginning if filled with excitement at tackling something new, and finally conquering the miles ahead of you. However, when you get into the middle, there's resentment and a thought of, "Why did I even try to do this?" That's exactly what I felt like when starting using Semantic. What started off as an easy hike quickly turned into climbing Everest to me. Okay maybe there's <i>some</i> exaggeration, but it was difficult. I think the difficult partly comes from the fact that Semantic uses a description based system that resembles regular English descriptions. For example, if I wanted to make a picture big, I'd just have to use the description of "ui big image". It's as simple as that. 

<b>"So, why is that hard?"</b>, you ask. Well little jimmy, it comes from the fact that there are endless combinations of descriptions that may or not work. Luckily, Semantic's website has all of the possible combinations that can be constructed and provides examples for how they can be assembled. Great! Except for the the problem that there are quite literally over 20 or so elements that can be modified and changed with even more elements. Remembering what can go with what can be quite the challenge. That's like the hike having forks with paths that circle aorund on itself and lead to other paths that are intertwined. There's an overwhelming sense of confusion. I had to stop and just think numerous times since I ended up taking the paths that lead to nowhere.

<b>Don't even get me started on the amount of divs needed.</b>

The numerous amount of <i><div></i> tags needed to separate and create each individual object kills me a little each time I have to make a new one. I get lost and start fumbling on where I even am. I'm now starting to have to backtrace the hike, but not even know where I am. There's a sense of redundancy when writing the code, since everything looks so similar, but creates different things. But alas, there's an end in sight to this pain of a hike.

# Look, the peak! #
In all honesty, learning the framework was an insightful experience that taught me how there are numerous approaches to coding, and even tools that can make things easier. This is my first time using a framework, and it was imported which restricted some capabilities, but creating designs with that was great in itself. I can only imagine the products that can be done with free control. 

Hey, what's that over there?

I'll just climb back down and save that for another time..
