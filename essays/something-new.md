# Blindly Heading In #
As I'm going into this field with no prior knowledge of really anything it entails aside from programming, software engineering is something that I'm not too familiar with myself. However, From what I've experienced so far, I think I have an idea of what it includes. I'm excited to enter the world of software engineering since the field ties in other languages that are learned to build and create a fully functional software. For example, I really enjoy how it can be done in css, html, and Javascript. Also, fiddling with the professional portfolio template has been exciting to see the possibilities of web design and the likes of something such as that. I haven't learned many languages yet, primarily only Java, so I'm excited to learn anything new that I can add onto my belt for future projects. I think software engineering is where the door to guide me to where I want to end up in opens up. 

# The Road Behind Me #
I actually started schooling as a biology major that was excited to experience the world of laboratory work and research. Those are quickly crushed after learning that working on a project that I may not be passionate about for months on end wouldn't be the most enjoyable thing for me. After talking to peers and professors, I dropped the pursuit and wandered around aimlessly wondering on what to do next. After months of debating on what to do next, I decided to try something I've never done before: computer science. I had never taken any classes nor done any self teaching, so I was fresh to try something out. I'm stuck and now end up here, still looking around at everything around me in confusion, hoping to catch onto some kind of sign that'll lead me to an end goal.

# Outlook # 
With the way my journey is going, I like the idea of coding as a team and having group work since it forces myself to think of other ways people approach coding. For example, for a practice pair assignment, my partner suggested using switches, but I suggested using if statements. I'd never think outside of my own bubble if I were to just continue to work by myself. So I hope to continue to develop a more "bigger picture" type of approach to coding where I can envision many routes to handle the solution rather than just my own set way of thinking. In the same token, quick thinking and flexibility is a skill I wish to develop and hone in software engineering. I'm in a period of struggle and constant fear of failure right now as I'm trying to learn a new language and getting used to new environments. Similarly to what I experienced when I first started programming, but in a worse condition. I hope that once I get over this slump that I can use what I learned from this experience and lessen the pressure and overwhelming feeling I feel next time around. 

However, just as much as I want to work on myself, I want to work on teambuilding and communicating more efficiently in a group setting. Very rarely are team projects seen as a good thing, and I myself hate them in most scenarios, but I want to put myself out there and work with a variety of individuals to develop a sense of how it is to work in a team setting where coding is the main priority, but everyone approaches it differently. What are the problems that are going to arise? How do we solve those amongst ourselves? These are the questions I can't wait to answer, whether it be a good experience or a bad experience. All of these combined can mold me into a prepared version of my current self for problems that I may experience in future in the field or just any side projects of my own.
