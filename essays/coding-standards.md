## yes

From the first moments of starting my career into programming I've been told to adhere to certain syntaxs and coding formats. At first I thought nothing about it since I was just following what I was taught. However, as I continued into courses with students of different programming backgrounds, I realized how important coding standards are for quality assurance. I once had a professor tell a story about her past job where people would discuss how certain coworker's codes are ugly and illegible. She ended it with saying, "You don't want to be one of those people. So follow how to write code properly and neatly."

Coding standards can be seen as like the grammar of coding. There are certain rules and exceptions to follow when writing code, and it takes practice and time to learn. With learning a language and its grammar rules, there are tools to help. For example in word there are different color underlines when there are certain grammar mistakes. There are similar tools with programming. One such tool would be ESLint. When used in the enviroment of Intelli J, there's a little indicator at the top right that signifies whether a code passes or fails proper syntax. If a code passes, there's a green checkmark and if a code fails, there's a red circle with an exclamation point.
