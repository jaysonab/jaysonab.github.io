## Sorry, Coding What? Coding Standards.

From the first moments of starting my career into programming I've been told to adhere to certain syntaxs and coding formats. At first I thought nothing about it since I was just following what I was taught. However, as I continued into courses with students of different programming backgrounds, I realized how important coding standards are for quality assurance. If everyone wrote code differently, how would anyone be able to understand how the code runs? Having a concrete coding style is like setting up a grammar system so everyone knows how to understand the common language spoken.

There are certain rules and exceptions to follow when writing code, and it takes practice and time to learn. With learning a language and its grammar rules, there are tools to help. For example in word there are different color underlines when there are certain grammar mistakes. There are similar tools with programming. One such tool would be ESLint. When used in the enviroment of Intelli J, there's a little indicator at the top right that signifies whether a code passes or fails proper syntax. If a code passes, there's a green checkmark and if a code fails, there's a red circle with an exclamation point. 
 
## But How is it Really?

From my experience of writing code, it hasn't been too hard following the syntax set up by my past professors and ESLint hasn't been too much of a challenge aswell. I use a lot of past code done as reference when writing new code, so I have a basis of what looks right and what doesn't. However, I think having the little experience I do with different languages also plays a role into how I understand the coding style of ESLint or Javascript in general. Since my experience up to now has been Java, I only learned how to code "the Java way," and that isn't too different from Javascript once I got used to everything.
