## Sorry, Coding What? Coding Standards.

From the first moments of starting my career into programming I've been told to adhere to certain syntaxes and coding formats. At first I thought nothing about it since I was just following what I was taught. However, as I continued into courses with students of different programming backgrounds, I realized how important coding standards are for quality assurance. If everyone wrote code differently, how would anyone be able to understand how the code runs? Imagine if everyone knew the English alphabet and the all of the same words, but constructed sentences by replacing the verbs with nouns or speaking backward sentences. It'd be hard to understand, right? Coding standards are like grammar rules. Although hard to initially learn and understand, once everything connects beautiful sentences can be constructed.

There are certain rules and exceptions to follow when writing code, and it takes practice and time to learn. With learning a language and its grammar rules, there are tools to help. For example in word there are different color underlines when there are certain grammar mistakes. There are similar tools with programming. One such tool would be ESLint. When used in the environment of IntelliJ, there's a little indicator at the top right that signifies whether a code passes or fails proper syntax. If a code passes, there's a green check mark and if a code fails, there's a red circle with an exclamation point. Along with that, similar to how word has the underlines indicating what's wrong, ESLint has also something similar. It points out if there are indentation errors or useless methods. Essentially, it helps correct and concise code to be as efficient as possible. 
 
## But How is it Really?

From my experience of writing code, it hasn't been too hard following the syntax set up by my past professors and ESLint hasn't been too much of a challenge as well. I use a lot of past code done as reference when writing new code, so I have a basis of what looks right and what doesn't. However, I think having the little experience I do with different languages also plays a role into how I understand the coding style of ESLint or Javascript in general. Since my experience up to now has been Java, I only learned how to code "the Java way," and that isn't too different from Javascript once I got used to everything. Getting used to ESLint and having to change the errors I make along the way actually helps me remember how things to should look and has been helpful in every regard.  

Having a coding standard to follow can seem like a trivial thing when it comes to little things such as spaces or just forgetting a semi-colon, but if you have thousands of lines of code with no way of knowing where the error is, how are you going to figure out where to begin to look? That's where the tools come into play to help pin-point where exactly things go wrong. There can be indicators telling you where it's wrong and *why* it's wrong. This not only benefits you, but anyone else who has to read your code since they can understand the same coding style.

Let's not code using hieroglyphics when we need to use English. Follow standards.
